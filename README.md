# Ryanair Flight FR4978

This project aims to visualize Ryanair Flight FR4978 data.

*"Ryanair Flight 4978 was a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Athens International Airport, Greece, to Vilnius Airport, Lithuania [...]. On 23 May 2021, while in Belarusian airspace, it was diverted by the Belarusian government to Minsk National Airport, where two of its passengers, opposition activist and journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, were arrested by authorities."* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair_Flight_4978]

Since Wikipedia is often considered not being reliable, suitable visualizations of the flight data are created in order to either confirm or reject the information provided by Wikipedia.

This project is part of the exam of the lecture "Data Visualization" at DHBW Ravensburg.

The notebook *Posterpr√§sentation.ipynb* contains all visualizations that have been part of the final solution. Moreover, all these visualizations are clearly arranged in the PDF-file *Poster_Flight_FR4978.pdf*.
